UPDATE 1: overhaul pretty much, refining the site to fit the asthetic more.
here is the NEW link [the highway]()

!!! please view this in desktop mode, the site does not work on miniature devices sorry!!!

i recommend clicking the link NOW and once you are done THEN reading the rest of this cuz its just bug notes & all that.
just don't want spoilers, yknow?

but do what you want i can't stop you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 1 fixes some bugs but i'm still at it!
lemme know for any bugs.

future builds will have better file management, better code management, and less buggy material hopefully.

so far, the actual 'thing' is just for showcase at the moment, this took me a pretty long time since this is my first project thingy so i hope you aren't super disappointed. 
cool stuff i think, and the website'll auto update whenever i make updates which is very very sick. lmbao do not mind the 51 updates i did before 'releasing'.

check back here for any updates whenever i feel motivated to, pretty important stuff i think. still no info here sorry!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

some previous bugs and refinements:

-simplified code
-fixed infographic going offscreen in full
-saving on the notepad works, it'll reload every time you close the app & leave the site. also disabled save and discard spamming.
-fixed notification icon going offscreen
-remastered the starting power button
-didn't redo the animation for the screen coming in, i thought about that it had flavor
-a little more older windows design assets, thanks to my friend, SHINGO!!!
-added a crt filter over the window
-added a bar at the bottom for a potential settings app
-remade the exit screen, ending in a similar fashion to older windows exit screens/shutdowns
-changed font, looks much more of-the-time in my opinion
-made applications bob a little for effect
-redid the icon for the highway planet and entire windowed look, with its fullscreen, minus, and discard icons and all, by my friend SHINGO tyty

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

still on my to-do list:

-settings menu for all your stuff
    >different border styles
    >unique cursor options
-more applications
-still thinking of a way to change the design of the notepad...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
